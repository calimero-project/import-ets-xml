[Archived] Import ETS XML into Calimero XML
=================================

*This repository is archived.* Use the [Calimero Tools datapoint importer](https://github.com/calimero-project/calimero-tools) for ETS 5.7 or later.

Transform KNX datapoints of ETS source XML documents to Calimero XML source documents. Tested with ETS 4.0.3 and ETS 5.x (latest v5.6.4). ETS 5.7 or later is not supported!

**Required steps**

1. Export your ETS project: click on _ETS_, select your project, and click _Export..._ . You get a file with the extension **.knxproj** (a ZIP archive). 
2. Check your ETS version (ETS 4/5)
3. Transform to Calimero XML using XSLT, either by using Gradle, Maven, or do it manually (see below).

**Know your ETS version!**

*Note: namespace version &ge; 20 is not supported.*

Select the correct version inside the calimero `xsl` file (line 5) you want to use. If you don't know the version, use _try and error_ with versions 11 to 14.
With the wrong version, the transformed output file will not contain any datapoints! This adjustment of the version is necessary due to ETS `.knxproj` files using versioned XML namespaces. 

* ETS 4 uses `http://knx.org/xml/project/11` or `http://knx.org/xml/project/12`
* ETS 5 uses `http://knx.org/xml/project/13` or `http://knx.org/xml/project/14`

By default, the transformation assumes a recent ETS 5 with namespace version `14`.

Import using Gradle
-------------------
* Copy the **.knxproj** archives into _src/main/resources_ (do not extract the archives).
* On the command line, execute `./gradlew`. The imported _calimero.xml_` file of each archive is written to the corresponding _build/imports/&lt;Project Name&gt;_ folder.

Import using Maven
------------------
  * Copy the **.knxproj** archives into _src/main/resources_ (do not extract the archives). 
  * Execute the Maven goal `process-resources`. For example, in the terminal change to the directory where the _pom.xml_ file resides, and type `mvn process-resources`. The output files are written to _target/generated-resources/xml/xslt_.

Manual import
-------------
  * Choose the appropriate XSL style sheet (see below).
  * Copy the chosen XSL file into the root directory of the extracted ETS project.
  * Invoke an appropriate XSLT tool. On Linux/MacOS you can use `xsltproc`, i.e., `xsltproc -o <output_XML_file> <XSL_file> <source_XML_file>`. On Microsoft Windows, you may use Saxon (http://saxon.sourceforge.net/).

Choose the appropriate XSL style sheet:

  * `ets_calimero_group.xsl`: Generates for each KNX group address one single datapoint. The resulting file can be loaded by Calimero.
  * `ets_calimero_group_name.xsl`: Generates for each KNX group address one single datapoint where the KNX group address name is used as name for the datapoint. The resulting file can be loaded by Calimero.
  * `ets_calimero.xsl`: Generates for each application object one single datapoint. Note that different application objects may have the same group address. Therefore, the output _cannot_ be imported into Calimero! However, it can be used for further (manual) processing.


The source XML file is called _0.xml_ which is contained within the sub directory that begins with a _P_, e.g., _P-0497_.

**Example invocation** 

`xsltproc -o calimero.xml ets_calimero_group_name.xsl P-0497/0.xml`
